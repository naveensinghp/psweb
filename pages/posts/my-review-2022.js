        <p>
          Here comes end of 2022, Well writing my first blog on this website, So might be quite sounds silly and some mistakes too, Please don&apos;t mind it,  <br/> <br/>
          Let me rewind myself towards 2022, On the January and half of month i was working software developer in <strong>VIDSYSOFT</strong> and doing same things following the same routines<br/> <br/>

          But working in the startup it&apos;s like challenging because you always being like pressure cooker, I had an chances to work in the mobile technology <b>(Flutter)</b>, Which is completely new to me, Still in the learning 

          <br/><br/>
          Then later in month launched my personal website, To have my digital garden space, Thinking to write more technical blogs and what running on minds, <br/><br/>
          On the month of November, One of my bucket list has been full filled i can say, Which was i brought the PS5 Consoleüòç Reason why i felt happy ps5 untill still now in the demand, so i feel lucky to have, I tired twice and thirce to place order in Shopatsc but does not happened, On luckily on fourth time i got it,
        </p>
        <br/> <br/>
          <Image src="/assets/images/console.png" alt="PS5 Console"  width={675} height={508} />
          <PhotoText>Playstation 5</PhotoText>
        <br/>
        <p>Sharing this might be sounds silly on the personal things, But i like to keep an record though as long this website stays into it</p> <br/>
        <h3>My Commits</h3> 
         <p>Looks like my github contributions graph are very less, But ok i am making progress</p><br/>
        <Image src="/assets/images/2022_git.png" alt="Console"  width={1828} height={448} />
        <br/>
        <p>Additionally level up my skilled in the flutter technology</p>
        <br/><br/>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            From the year of conclusion what i can say to myself was that i should do more things like creating value on myself, Creating my own reputation to the work as well on the developer community side, I should not be lazy to do, I should constantly upgrade myself, 
          </p><br/>
          <p>People around the world going through some of COVID cases and lot of some unknown disease, So on let this year(2023) brings lot of joy and peace to the world</p> <br/>
          <p>So yeah that&apos;s it, Wishing you very Happy New Year-2023 üçæ</p>
